\chapter{Conclusion}

Evaluating the SAFE Network in its current state does the project an injustice, it is not finished yet. Uncertainties in implementation details, especially \textit{Safecoin}, brings into question how successful the project will be in the long run. Proper incentives for \textit{vault} owners is crucial in the success of the network. The next big step for Maidsafe is the implementation of Datachain's (Section \ref{sec:datachain}) and it will be very interesting to see how successful they are.

The SAFE Network ultimately provides an interesting new way to develop applications and services. Developers will have to re-think how they build applications to exploit the characteristics of the SAFE Network to their benefit. Although SAFE Wiki demonstrates that the secure storage and retrieval of data is already possible, the feasibility of running large websites and services that require extremely fast processing needs to be researched fully. The performance of how a world wide SAFE Network with dynamic growth and decay will only be known once it fully launches.

The passion exerted by the team at Maidsafe can only inspire confidence in that they will try their very hardest to achieve all of their goals. This is in-spite of all of the challenges that they still have to solve. The success of the SAFE Network is not only dictated by its success, but by the success of any projects that are built because of it. Whether this be a SAFE Network ``2.0'' or an entirely new project that Maidsafe has laid the foundations for.

\section{Personal Reflection}

This project was one of the most difficult I have ever undertaken. The lack of resources available made development extremely difficult and tiring at times. It took a good few months before I was even comfortable with the basic concepts of the SAFE Network. Indeed I discovered some of my knowledge was completely flawed while writing this dissertation.

I am very proud of the application that was developed, SAFE Wiki is a good example of what the SAFE Network can do. If and when the SAFE Network fully launches, I hope that some may find SAFE Wiki of actual use.

The biggest thing I learned from this project is that community in software development is important. Without the help of the community around the SAFE Network, this project simply wouldn't have been possible. When I first announced my project on the forums\footnote{https://safenetforum.org/t/safe-wiki-wikipedia-on-the-safe-network/21493}, it was exciting to hear the positive response from the community. A few even tried SAFE Wiki out for themselves! It is through this community involvement that I have been invited to speak at Maidsafe's first dev-conference, an extremely exciting opportunity to develop myself professionally.

\section{Acknowledgements}

This project would not have been possible without the support of my supervisor Inah Omoronyia, a huge thank you to him.

Maidsafe were gracious enough to invite us to their headquarters in Ayr, the hour we spent together was very illuminating.

To the community members that answered the many queries and questions that I had, I owe a great deal of thanks. Without their help this project would not have been possible.

The creators of Kiwix are truly inspiring people. The work that they do in delivering free educational content to the people who need it most is very noble. I hope to be able to contribute something back to their projects in the future.
