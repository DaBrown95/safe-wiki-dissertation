\title{Building Applications on the SAFE Network}
\author{David Brown}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

Decentralised data storage networks present exciting new ways to build applications, the SAFE Network is such a system. To explore its effectiveness an application called SAFE Wiki was built. SAFE Wiki facilitates the storage and browsing of websites like Wikipedia on the SAFE Network. From the evaluation of the current implementation of the SAFE Network, numerous issues have been highlighted. The rigidity of how applications must be built presents challenges for software development. Whether these challenges can be solved dictates the ultimate success of the SAFE Network.
